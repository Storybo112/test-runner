 * Playwright caches the transform plugin from the test-runner, so if you make changes and rebuild,
 * these changes would not be reflected in the test-runner. This script (hooked to nodemon) makes sure that
 * whenever you change the csf-playwright-plugin.ts file, the cache is cleared and you actually get your changes.
